# Healthcare-and-Pharmaceutical- Risk Assessment and Confounding Factors
Producers.docx: This document involves defining key epidemiological terms (incidence and prevalence), calculating incidence and prevalence rates, assessing risks and risk ratios from a clinical trial, identifying and illustrating confounding variables with a DAG, and calculating odds ratios from observational data to evaluate the potential confounding effect of age on the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Producers.R: This project involves verifying hand-calculated epidemiological metrics using logistic regression, understanding the role of predictors in disease prediction models versus causal inference models, and calculating sensitivity and specificity for a new medical device. The results from statistical software confirm hand calculations and reveal insights into potential confounding factors and the predictive power of various variables.

EMRData.R : This project involves an advanced epidemiological analysis and predictive modeling using healthcare data. First, descriptive statistics for key variables like Age, Severity of Illness, and Length of Stay (LOS) are provided. We computed the Odds Ratio (OR) for different age categories with the base category 21-30, both with and without controlling for confounding variables, revealing how the OR changes when accounting for these confounders. Next, a machine learning model was employed to predict the Severity of Illness, providing visualizations, a confusion matrix, and performance metrics. The analysis was extended to LOS, with visualizations and predictive analytics conducted. The project also includes the computation of marginal effects to offer a deeper understanding of the predictors' impacts. The report (Claims&MedicalCost.docx (Part 2)) combines charts, tables, and written analysis to present a comprehensive view of the findings.

Claims&MedicalCost.docx: This document explores the application of machine learning in healthcare by addressing its potential and limitations. It provides examples where machine learning is particularly suitable, such as predictive modeling for disease outbreaks or personalized treatment plans, due to its ability to analyze large datasets and identify patterns. Conversely, it also highlights scenarios where machine learning might not be the best approach, such as situations requiring complex human judgment or empathy. The epidemiologic transition theory is discussed, illustrating how healthcare providers and analysts shift their focus from infectious to chronic diseases as countries develop. Additionally, the assignment includes a case study of an analytics company working in disease diagnostics, examining their approach's strengths and weaknesses, and suggesting improvements. The analysis emphasizes the evolving role of machine learning in healthcare and the need for continuous adaptation and enhancement of analytical methods.
