# Healthcare-and-Pharmaceutical- Risk Assessment and Confounding Factors
Producers.docx: This project involves defining key epidemiological terms (incidence and prevalence), calculating incidence and prevalence rates, assessing risks and risk ratios from a clinical trial, identifying and illustrating confounding variables with a DAG, and calculating odds ratios from observational data to evaluate the potential confounding effect of age on the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Producers.R: This project involves verifying hand-calculated epidemiological metrics using logistic regression, understanding the role of predictors in disease prediction models versus causal inference models, and calculating sensitivity and specificity for a new medical device. The results from statistical software confirm hand calculations and reveal insights into potential confounding factors and the predictive power of various variables.
